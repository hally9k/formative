## Quick Start

Install the package with your favorite package manager

`npm install --save formative` &nbsp; / &nbsp; `yarn add formative`

Import the `useForm` &nbsp; hook into your React component

`embed:quick-start.ts`

> An important note here is that the fields are bound to their respective parts of the form state by their `name` attributes. It would be wise to use an `enum` to define these to ensure they remain aligned and can be renamed easily.
